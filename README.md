A human's guide to... whatever I have time and interest to write about.

## Target audience

The is for a general audience. Technology and science are becoming importart parts of our world. I am writing this for those that have an interest in, or just want to learn to live with, our modern world.

There is a term "Explain it like I am 5", that means provide me with an explanation that is simple enough that a child can understand it. What if you not a child. Maybe you are closer to 50 (give or take 20 years). You are smart, but do not always have hours to spend on research, when all you need is a two minute summary. Wikipedia often provides that, but just as often assumes you have some knowlage of that field, thus requiring more research to understand that short summary.
